# Timestamp adder script

Inspired by old point&shoots that had a setting to add timestamps to pictures. The script is meant to be executed in a directory full of pictures. A font (ttf file) and logo can be supllied. Their paths can be relative or absolute. A timestamp based on exif data and logo will be added to the bottom middle of every picture.

Other variables:

Logo scale: The logo will take up 1/x of the x-axis
Image padding: Can be increased to raise the logo further up from the timestamp
Text size: Changes the size of the timestamp
Text padding: Can be increased to raise the timestamp further up from the bottom edge
